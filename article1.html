            Lying down. Eating snacks. Saving lives. Really, what’s not to like about giving blood?
            <p>After all, you have something inside you that no factory can make, and that a lot of people need in order to survive. You can give it safely, in about an hour, and you’ll barely feel a thing.
                Did I mention the snacks? They’re free. So are the friendly smiles of the blood drive staff and volunteers (you can really tell they’re smiling through their masks.)</p>
            <p>also free? The feeling that you’re helping your fellow humans, though you’ll never know exactly which ones.
                I’ve been donating blood for decades, a few times a year, even through the pandemic (and yes, even after all three of my COVID vaccine doses.)
                I’ve even got a pin to prove that I’ve given five gallons of my blood, which works out to about 40 donations.</p>
                So I’ve collected some of my favorite insider tips about donating blood.</p>
            <p>If you’ve never given blood, or you did it long ago but stopped, this is a great time to start. There’s actually a shortage of blood right now, and blood banks are pulling out all the stops to bring in more donations before people get busy during the holiday season.
                Take, for instance, the Blood Battle between the University of Michigan and Ohio State University. It’s a contest to see which school can bring in the most blood donors in the month before the football rivals meet on the field.
                I’m proud to say I scored a point for U-M this week by giving at a drive on campus. There are plenty of blood donation appointments still open before the competition ends November 24.</p>
